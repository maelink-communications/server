> [!WARNING]
> This code is soon to be refactored. Please use the more up-to-date `no-more-onefile` branch which has multiple QOL fixes.

## HOW TO RUN

You need to install through Deno:

`npm:chalk, npm:sqlite3, npm:sequelize, jsr:@felix/bcrypt`

Once you have installed the packages you can now run the server with:

`deno run --allow-all main.js`
